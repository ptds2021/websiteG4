The Shiny App is created with the ambitious purpose of providing support to Nestlè employees during the industrial process of coffè capsules creations. The application is made with the idea of optimizing the data record by adding manually imput data about the industrial process directly from the shiny and to visualize in real time statistical charts to visualize whether the process is under control or not. 

It mainly consist of 3 parts:

* Input

* Visualizations

* App Info

---

The very first part is the *"Input"* , we observe our data-frame with our specific columns *"Date"* , *"Measure 1 "*,*"Measure 2"* ,*"Measure 3"* ,*"Measure 4"* ,*"Measure 5"* ,*"Measure 6"* ,*"Operator"* ,*"Process.Sample"* ,*"Size"* ,*"Target.Value"* ,*"Tare"*.

These variables are of main of interest. We designed our Shiny app in a way that it allows user to select and edit the data input type and then recording it with the *"Submit"* button that displays the given information in the data-table shown below.

In the bottom part of the input window it is shown the relationship between Measures and Tare. 

At the end, a summary table giving statistics is provided. 
*"mean"
*"sd"
*"median"
*"quantiles".

The second window is called: *"visualizations"*. It has been done by according to the *"Request"* value. 

This section is dedicated to visualizing process control statistics.

An *Xbar chart* is provided the user to check whether the process is within the upper and lower Control Limit.
  
a *statistical table*  shows some values like: Process Median, Process Cible, Process Mean Deviation, Upper Control Limit, Lower Control Limit , Number Beyond Limits, Out of Control (%).

The third window is called *"App Info"* providing general information about the purpose of the app and to who it is dedicated.
