## Main purpose

The Shiny Application is created with the ambitious purpose of providing support to employees during the industrial process. The application was made with the aim of optimizing data record by adding manually imput data about the industrial process directly from the shiny and to visualize in real time statistical charts, also helping to understand whether the process is under control or not. 

---

It mainly consist of 3 parts:

* ##### INPUT

* ##### DENSITY PLOT

* ##### TIME SERIES FOR OPERATORS

* ##### APP INFO

---

### Input

The very first part allow the user to add manually imputs.

The specific inputs are: *"Date"* , *"Measure 1 "*,*"Measure 2"* ,*"Measure 3"* ,*"Measure 4"* ,*"Measure 5"* ,*"Measure 6"* ,*"Operator"* ,*"Process.Sample"* ,*"Size"* ,*"Target.Value"* ,*"Tare"*.

The user can import and store the measurement directly on the interface with the *"Submit"* button that will displays the given added information in the data-table placed below the input windows 



At the end, a summary table giving general statistics is provided. 
 

---

### Density Plot

The second window is dedicated to the statistical process control



An *density chart* is provided to check the process sample distribution.
  
A *statistical table*  shows some values like: Process Median, Process Cible, Process Mean Deviation, Upper Control Limit, Lower Control Limit , Number Beyond Limits, Out of Control (%). 

An *R chart* for the request number

---

### Time Series for operations

It is possible to visualize each sample of a specific request comparing also the proximity with the median and the target. 
  
---

### App Info

Last tab, provide a quick description of the project and the app purpose
