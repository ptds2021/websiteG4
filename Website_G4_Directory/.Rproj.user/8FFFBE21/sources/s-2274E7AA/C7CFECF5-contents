title: Shiny App 
---


  This Shiny App is created by the HEC Management / Business Analyst students with the colloboration of the Company "Nespresso". It is dedicated only for the use of Nespresso employees in order to allow them to optimize their work by giving them the possibility of simulating several graph and scenerios specific to their work. 

  It mainly consist of 3 parts *"Input"* ,*"Density Plot"* ,*"App Info"* . 

  The very first part is the *"Input"* , we observe our data-frame with our specific columns *"Date"* , *"Measure 1 "*,*"Measure 2"* ,*"Measure 3"* ,*"Measure 4"* ,*"Measure 5"* ,*"Measure 6"* ,*"Operator"* ,*"Process.Sample"* ,*"Size"* ,*"Target.Value"* ,*"Tare"*. These variables are of main of interest. We designed our Shiny app in a way that it allows user to select these variables as they wishes and then the *"Submit"* button displays the given information in the data-table shown below.

Below the same page, we have our plot which shows that on x-axis "Measures" specified and on y-axis , the difference between Measures and Tare to observe clearly their relationship. 

At the end , we have a summary table of all "Measures" that we specified in our Shiny such that "mean", "sd","median" and "quantiles".  


  The second part page *"Density Plot"*. It has been done by according to the *"Request"* where we allow user to choose their value. The result is the two plot where we observe one related to Cpk analysis and the other is "Process Sample" plot which aims at visualizing the user the process median and upper and lower Control Limit where we observe if we have some extreme process that goes out of control. We should be worried for the values that exceeds these bounds.
  
We have a table that shows the specific values for which we have specifically the Process Median, Process Cible, Process Mean Deviation, Upper Control Limit, Lower Control Limit , Number Beyond Limits, Out of Control (%). 


  The third part is called *"App Info"* where we present the main idea and the purpose of this Shiny-App and to who it is dedicated.
