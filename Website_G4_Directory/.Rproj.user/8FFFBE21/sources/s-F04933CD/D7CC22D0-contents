### About the website:

Dear reader,

This website is created for the purpose of a project in the course of "Programming Tools in Data Science" realized within HEC Lausanne. 

The website is made of two separated sections: 

1. First part aims to give a detailed information about the package created to be exploited for production control purpose.

2. Second part gives a detailed explanation about our shiny-app built upon the package, with the interface that allow the user to discover much more functionalities.
